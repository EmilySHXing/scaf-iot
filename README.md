# Smart Cat Auto Feeder(SCAF)

This is the repo for Purdue ECE477 Senior Design - Fall2020 Team 20. Here we posted our code for the integration of our ESP32 microcontroller, together with hx711 weight sensor, BS412 PIR sensor, ILI3940 LCD display, DRV 8825 motor driver, and NEMA 12 stepper motor. We also use Google IOT and Google Firebase for the comminucation between database and the microcontroller.

*The libraries are compatible with C programming language.
